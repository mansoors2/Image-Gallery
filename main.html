      <p> Muslims celebrate Eid twice a year.Eid-ul-Adha is one of two Eid holidays observed by Muslims. The other is Eid al-Fitr, which follows the conclusion of Ramadan, the month of fasting.</p>
      <br></br><p><strong>Eid al-Fitr</strong> means "festival of breaking the fast" and marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. It is celebrate for three days, and on the morning of the first day, Muslims gather for prayer. Eid is also infused with different traditions in different countries. Most people use the three days of Eid for visitations. Other traditions include the Eidiyah, money given to kids on Eid and wearing new clothes.
        Eid begins with the first sighting of the new moon, so most of the time Muslims have to wait until the night before Eid to verify its date. The starting day varies every year and from country to country depending on geographical location.</p>

   <br></br><p> I am from Pakistan so, our celebrations include getting together for a lunch or dinner on the first day. In the mornings, we all (mostly, the men) go to the local mosque to pray.
     When we lived in Pakistan, we would celebrate Eid for more than one day but due to lack of paid time-off for Eid, we usually celebrate just the first day.
     My dad gives money to my siblings and I upon returning from the prayer. He also sings as he gives out the money, known as Eidi.
